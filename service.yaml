spec:
  type: ClusterIP   # default
  #clusterIP: None  # headless service - returns all A records instead of round robin. Useful for seeding (eg. Cassandra, Elasticsearch), or Service Discovery where load balancing is not needed (eg. Jenkins / TeamCity server)
  #type: NodePort
  #type: LoadBalancer
  #type: ExternalName
  #externalName: NAME.DOMAIN.COM  # returns a CNAME pointing to NAME.DOMAIN.COM, as a cluster stable internal reference to an external resource which might change
  #externalName: myservice.default.svc.cluster.local

  # =======================
  # NodePort / LoadBalancer

  # External traffic policy routes NodePort requests only to pods on same node
  # - pros:
  #   - NodePort is only opened on nodes containing the pod, essentially allowing pods to control which nodes the LoadBalanacer routes through via pod placement and LB healthchecks
  #   - one less hop inside cluster
  #   - pod receives client's IP (X-Forwarded-For is more useful if you're using Cloudflare Proxied protections for Layer 7 HTTP, or PROXY protocol header for Layer 4 TCP)
  # - cons:
  #   - can cause load imbalances between pods (which is why this is not the default)
  # - not needed for HTTP(s) services using Ingress -> default ClusterIP services
  #externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster  # default, distribute to all service endpoints (pods) inside cluster

#    - x.x.x.x/32
#    # Cloudflare Proxied IP ranges (only these are seen when running DNS records in fully Proxied mode)
#    #                               client IPs become masked to these, use X-Forwarded-For in app, and
#    #                               restrict Cloudflare Firewall for Dev/Staging environments to only VPN / Office / 3rd party webhook addresses
#    #                               since otherwise all clients will go through your firewall and ingress as one of the below addresses
